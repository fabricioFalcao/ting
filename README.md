# Document Indexing Simulation Project

In this project, you will implement a program that simulates a document indexing algorithm similar to Google's. The program should identify occurrences of terms in TXT files.

## Skills Developed

- Manipulating Stacks
- Manipulating Deques
- Manipulating Nodes & Linked Lists
- Manipulating Doubly Linked Lists

## Modules

### File Management Module

- Allows attaching TXT files for indexing purposes.

### Search Module

- Enables search functionalities across the attached files.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on implementing core data structures (stacks, deques, linked lists) and developing basic search functionalities without semantic analysis or synonym search.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the document indexing simulation.
- **Stacks and Deques**: Employed for managing file attachments and search operations.
- **Linked Lists**: Utilized for efficient data storage and manipulation.
- **Text File Handling**: Reading and processing TXT files for indexing purposes.
- **Search Algorithms**: Basic search functionalities implemented for term occurrences.

This project aims to strengthen skills in data structure manipulation and basic search algorithms using Python.
