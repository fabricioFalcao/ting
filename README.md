# Document Indexing Simulation Project

During this project, I implemented a program that simulated a document indexing algorithm similar to Google's. The program identified occurrences of terms in TXT files.

## Skills Developed

- Developed proficiency in manipulating stacks, deques, nodes, and doubly linked lists.
- Improved understanding of basic search functionalities.

## Modules

### File Management Module

- Implemented the ability to attach TXT files for indexing purposes.

### Search Module

- Developed search functionalities across the attached files.

## Project Scope

The project focused on implementing core data structures (stacks, deques, linked lists) and developing basic search functionalities without semantic analysis or synonym search.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Utilized for implementing the document indexing simulation.
- **Stacks and Deques**: Employed for managing file attachments and search operations.
- **Linked Lists**: Utilized for efficient data storage and manipulation.
- **Text File Handling**: Processed TXT files for indexing purposes.
- **Search Algorithms**: Basic search functionalities implemented for term occurrences.

This project enhanced my skills in data structure manipulation and basic search algorithms using Python.
